		<p class="rec">Wanna know why? Better be prepared to dredge through another three pages of my sleep-inducing dithering, sorry I even bothered trying though, maybe I'll just start speaking in spanish to see if anyone notices. Hola, como esta? Estoy bien pero estoy muy descansado y tengo sueno. Pero yo estoy creyendo este sitio del Web y no puedo parrar antes de que nuesto avion llegue en Canada. Que triste, no?</p>

			<p class="rec">It was in the office after someone had a birthday, but after a couple weeks the mold and ants worked to spell out "Great" so I just assumed they were talking about [product].</p>

		<div class="userRec">
			<img src="css/images/balloon.png" class="userImg">
			<p class="userName">Sad_Deflated_Balloon</p>
			<p class="rec">Also left over from the birthday. It used to say 'Happy Birthday Karen' but then as it deflated the folds kind of made it look like 'Ha rth da re' which I took as a huge compliment to [product]! Such high praise needed to be sung from the internet as the kids these days say!</p>

		<div class="userRec">
			<img src="css/images/octopus4.png" class="userImg">
			<p class="userName">This_Normal_Dude_I_Met_On_The_Street</p>
			<p class="rec">I once used [product] to attempt to take over the wo- sorry I mean improve [task product improves]. Definitely not to try to take over the world with my lizard people bretheren. Definitely not that. Who said anything about lizard people?</p>
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="userRec">
			<img src="css/new/moneybags.png" class="userImg">
			<p class="userName">Money_Man_McMoneyBags</p>
			<p class="rec">A literal bag of money. He couldn't actually say anything say anything because, y'know, he's literally money. But if he could talk I'm sure he would love [product].</p>
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="userRec">
			<img src="css/new/globe.png" class="userImg">
			<p class="userName">The_Rl_Whole_World</p>
			<p class="rec">I, the REAL whole world, would like to endorse [product] as a modern miracle of science! And while I have your attention, I'd also like to formally declare my intent to run for President of the United States in 2016! Down with Lizard People! What have they ever done for us?! Oh wait did I say lizard people? Who said anything about lizard people? Definitely not me. I just meant people who like cats! No one likes them anyway!</p>

		<h2><i>Living Your Dream</i></h2>
		<p class="rec">Or, y'know, whatever it is you do instead of doing that. BUT, the point is that using out proprietary [product goes here] you'll be able to achieve things you never believed possible (but seriously, look at the beaver thing! Doesn't he look surprised at what he figured out he could do with [product]??) </p>
