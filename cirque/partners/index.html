							<h2>Enactus Queen's</h2>
							<p>
								The Queen’s division of Enactus will be running a mini pitch competition on Day 1 of the conference. Teams of delegates will be tasked with pitching a creative and out-of-the-box product/idea given by the Enactus reps! They will have time to mull over how to pitch their product/idea with the goal of getting an investment. Feedback will be provided on pitch and presentation skills. Entrepreneurs contain a diverse set of social skills that engineers would benefit from having, so the goal of this workshop is to help engineering undergrads expand their social and presentation skills! These skills will be important for later events to come!! If you’re also looking for extra-curricular opportunities, come check this workshop out to gain perspective on what the students from Enactus Queen’s do!

							<h2>Enactus Queen's</h2>
							<p>
								The Queen’s division of Enactus will be running a mini pitch competition on Day 1 of the conference. Teams of delegates will be tasked with pitching a creative and out-of-the-box product/idea given by the Enactus reps! They will have time to mull over how to pitch their product/idea with the goal of getting an investment. Feedback will be provided on pitch and presentation skills. Entrepreneurs contain a diverse set of social skills that engineers would benefit from having, so the goal of this workshop is to help engineering undergrads expand their social and presentation skills! These skills will be important for later events to come!! If you’re also looking for extra-curricular opportunities, come check this workshop out to gain perspective on what the students from Enactus Queen’s do!

							<h2>Scotiabank</h2>
							<p>
								CIRQUE 2018’s sponsor will be giving delegates the opportunity to participate in one of two interactive workshops! The first will be focused on Scotiabank’s international outreach. This workshop will challenge delegates to critically think about their potential for global outreach, within or outside of the field of engineering! The mot active participants will have the chance to interact directly with Scotiabank’s awesome reps, and earn free prizes!! If you are looking for a super interactive and informative session, this is the workshop for you!
							</p>
							<p>
								Scotiabank’s second workshop gives delegates another opportunity at a pitch competition! Delegates can apply skills gained through the Enactus workshop, but this time they will be pitching their own unique stocks!! Delegates can sharpen up on skills gained the day before and put themselves in the spotlight in front of their peers and sponsorship reps! If you crave competition and want bragging rights over your peers, this is the workshop for you!
