								My name is Michael Albinson and I'm a fourth year dual degree candidate in Biomechanical Engineering
								and Computing at Queen's University. I thrive when working in teams, am very self directed,
								and am a fast learner. I am willing to put my nose to the grindstone in order to excel and deliver.
								Challenges that other people shy away from are my bread and butter. I love to take on the new,
								the demanding, and the seemingly impossible.

						<p>Michael is in his fourth year of Mechanical Engineering (academic scholarship, dean's list) at
							Queen's University and really enjoying MATLAB and design projects. He is also a candidate for
							a dual degree in Computing. He thrives working in teams, is very self directed, and a fast learner.
							He is willing to put his nose to the grindstone in order to excel and deliver.
						</p><p>
							Not afraid of challenges, Michael is a driven contributor and focused on having an impact as part of a team.
						</p><p>
							A builder in every sense of the word, Michael built his own drone at Tech Shop in San Francisco
							by fabricating his own parts. He coded his own games at the Digital Media Academy at the
							University of Toronto in java. Michael helped build houses with Habitat for Humanity in New Orleans,
							and contributed to other service projects in Chile (earthquake recovery) and the Dominican Republic.
